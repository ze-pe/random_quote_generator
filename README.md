# random_quote_generator

## Goals
- When I click on the button “show another quote” I should be able to get a random quote.

## Specifications
1. For this mini-project, you can either use arrays to store quotes and display them after clicking the “show another quote” button or you can use JavaScript async/await with the fetch API to pull random quotes. 
2. Be sure to style the page in the way you prefer. It does not need to look exactly like the example. 
3. Remember you are manipulating DOM elements, so use all you learned this week: Creating elements, getting elements, and creating  “click” events. 
4. Deploy your code on Github pages or Netlify. 
5. Send us your GitHub link with the deployed code in the JWD Student Channel.

## Resources 
- const url="https://type.fit/api/quotes" 

- There are many APIs out there. Github has a large library. Look for quote APIs with no authorization necessary or with an api key. https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists

## Bonus 1
- If you finish before time is up, then try out this bonus material.
- Add an input section (dropdown menu, maybe) to input a famous person’s name.
- When you click on the button “Quote Me”, a random quote will show up from that specific person.
